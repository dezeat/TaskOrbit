# we need


# db
# task-id, task-name, task-ts-created, task-desc, task-color, task-ts-acomplished, task-ts-deadline


# i need the following functionality (CRUD) with an orm 
# here the assumption is, everything is setup correctly
# insert task
# update task
# remove-task
# Select / Read all entries




# modular-approach (ORM)
# I want to read a config, which gives the details for the db, if none provided a sql-lite instance will be created
# when one is provided, it is checked, if the tables are already in place with the correct schema
# if not they are created
